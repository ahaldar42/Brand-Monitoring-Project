# Brand-Monitoring-Project

Have you ever tweeted about an excellent product, tagging the company? 
Does the company engage with you? Does the company even read the tweet?
Gone are the days where a company’s interaction with customers was limited to store visits and support phone. Today’s customers engage with a brand over various social media.  In order for companies to excel at engaging with their customers in a genuine way, they must first understand what is being said and what conversations to filter out and what to tune in.

I built a prototype for Brand monitoring and Social listening. It is an essential tool for companies to build relationships with customers. I worked on observing and analysing data collected from the Twitter APIs with the hashtag `#Walmart`.  Twitter is crucial to discover and understand real time trends, important customer discussions. 

My analysis can provide valuable insights to the marketing team, such as understanding of sentiment of the tweets and the overall perception of the brand, topics and keywords related to the brand, its reach and engagement. My analysis shows that powerful insights can be gained easily by by simple analysis.
